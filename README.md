## About Me 

hey internet void. it's 3:33 AM again and i'm here, caffeinated and contemplating the universe through IntelliJ's dark theme. I am raised on minecraft mods and stack overflow anxiety. i used to think i understood java back when i was seventeen and the world made sense. now i'm nineteen and everything is on fire but at least my code has better variable names.

this repository exists somewhere between a digital diary and a desperate attempt to remember why i fell in love with programming in the first place. it's giving "i peaked in high school computer science" energy but with more existential dread and better playlist curation. 

currently oscillating between "i am the main character of my own coding journey" and "we are all just NPCs in someone else's algorithm." the duality of gen-z, i guess.

## What's in here?

- **Variables & Data Types** - learning to name things properly because apparently `temp` and `thing1` don't count as professional
- **Control Flow Chaos** - if statements that mirror my decision-making process (chaotic, recursive, probably unnecessary)
- **Object-Oriented Overthinking** - classes, inheritance, and the philosophical implications of polymorphism at 2 AM
- **String Manipulation** - because everything is a string if you're brave enough, including your feelings
- **Exception Handling** - try-catch blocks for when life throws you curveballs (it's giving therapy energy)
- **Collections & Data Structures** - ArrayLists for my scattered thoughts, HashMaps for my complex emotions
- **File I/O Adventures** - reading files like i read my own journal entries from 2019 (with regret and fascination)
- **Recursion Rabbit Holes** - functions calling themselves like me texting my ex at midnight
- **Lambda Expressions** - because functional programming is just regular programming with commitment issues
- **Streams & Parallel Processing** - multithreading like my brain when i have five projects due tomorrow

## Why Now?

picture this: it's july 2025, spotify is on repeat, and i'm realizing that my java knowledge has the same energy as my 2023 sourdough starter - abandoned, forgotten, but somehow still alive in the depths of my memory. 

i spent three years thinking i was too cool for java, chasing the aesthetic of full stack and the validation of javascript frameworks. but there's something beautifully masochistic about returning to your first programming language like it's your hometown - everything looks smaller than you remembered, but the muscle memory hits different.

also, my computer science professor assigned a project in java and i panicked because i couldn't remember how to make a simple class without googling it. the audacity of my past self thinking i had "mastered" java at seventeen. the hubris. the absolute main character energy.

so here we are. me, my IDE, and the crushing weight of imposter syndrome, ready to debug both my code and my life choices. it's giving "academic comeback story" meets "quarter-life crisis at nineteen" meets "maybe i should have stuck with java all along."

## Current Vibe Check

ðŸŒ™ **Mood**: melancholic but determined  
â˜• **Caffeine Level**: concerning  
ðŸŽµ **Current Playlist**: null-pointer-exception  
ðŸ”¥ **Motivation**: flickering like my laptop screen at 4 AM

*"in the end, we are all just null pointer exceptions in the vast codebase of existence, waiting for someone to handle us with grace"*

**~ a prayer for all the developers who code in the dark, debug in the light, and dream in syntax errors ~**

*Abhinay*
